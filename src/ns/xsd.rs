For non-timezoned     values, the top-open intervals disjointly cover the non-timezoned timeline,     one per day. For timezoned values, the intervals begin at every minute and     therefore overlap.

    /// `double`:      The double datatype is patterned after the IEEE double-precision 64-bit     floating point datatype [IEEE 754-2008]. Each floating point datatype has a     value space that is a subset of the rational numbers. Floating point     numbers are often used to approximate arbitrary real numbers.   
    double, "double",
    /// `duration`:      duration is a datatype that represents durations of time. The concept of     duration being captured is drawn from those of [ISO 8601], specifically     durations without fixed endpoints. For example, "15 days" (whose most     common lexical representation in duration is "'P15D'") is a duration value;     "15 days beginning 12 July 1995" and "15 days ending 12 July 1995" are not     duration values. duration can provide addition and subtraction operations     between duration values and between duration/dateTime value pairs, and can     be the result of subtracting dateTime values. However, only addition to     dateTime is required for XML Schema processing and is defined in the     function ·dateTimePlusDuration·.

    /// `float`:      The float datatype is patterned after the IEEE single-precision 32-bit     floating point datatype [IEEE 754-2008]. Its value space is a subset of the     rational numbers. Floating point numbers are often used to approximate     arbitrary real numbers.

    /// `gDay`:      gDay represents whole days within an arbitrary month—days that recur at the     same point in each (Gregorian) month.
