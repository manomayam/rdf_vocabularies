As the second part of Records in Contexts standard,                     it is a formal representation of Records in Contexts Conceptual Model (RiC-CM).                     This version, which is v0.2, is the current official release. It is compliant                     with RiC-CM v0.2, that will be published soon after the release of RiC-O                     v0.2.</html:p>                 <html:p>The following diagram shows the main RiC-CM v0.2 entities and a few                     relations between them: <html:img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ICA-EGAD/RiC-O/master/diagrams/diagrams_v0-2/RiC-CM-overview/diagram_RiC-CM-overview-RiC-v0-2.jpg" alt="A partial overview of RiC-CM v0.2 main entities" class="diagram"></html:img>                 </html:p>                 <html:div id="design-principles">                     <html:h4>RiC-O design principles</html:h4>                     <html:p>The following design principles were followed when developing                         RiC-O.</html:p>                     <html:p>                         <html:strong>RiC-O is a domain or reference ontology</html:strong>.</html:p>                     <html:p>It provides a generic vocabulary and formal rules for creating RDF                         datasets (or generating them from existing archival metadata) that describe                         in a consistent way any kind of archival record resource. It can support                         publishing RDF datasets as Linked Data, querying them using SPARQL, and                         making inferences using the logic of the ontology.</html:p>                     <html:p>While some projects have built some specific ontologies for describing                         archives, at this time no generic domain ontology exists for the specific                         needs of the archival community. This is why EGAD decided to develop RiC-O                         as the second part of RiC standard.</html:p>                     <html:p>Apart this first, main target, RiC-O also can help archival institutions                         and engineers to design and develop other technical implementations of                         RiC-CM that represent record resources and their layers of contexts as                         oriented, interconnected graphs. Of course, other technical implementations                         may be developed later on, including XML models, or (hopefully) new versions                         of EAD and EAC-CPF XML models.</html:p>                     <html:p>As RiC-O is a generic, domain ontology, it does not address by itself                         every specific need or expectation that may occur in every archival                         institution or project. It is rather a high level framework and a project                         can either limit itself to the use of a selection of components, or can add                         more subcomponents where needed.</html:p>                     <html:p>As a domain ontology, RiC-O, at this stage at least, does not borrow any                         component from other existing ontologies (such as the cultural heritage                         models – IFLA-LRM and CIDOC-CRM, PREMIS, or PROV-O). It should therefore be                         easier, for an archival institution or archival project, to understand,                         implement and maintain RiC-O within its system.</html:p>                     <html:p>Later on, RiC-O will be aligned with these existing models. This is of                         course essential for interconnecting RDF datasets conforming to RiC-O with                         other datasets, or for using parts of RiC-O in other contexts than the                         archival or records management realm.</html:p>                     <html:p>                         <html:strong>RiC-O must be immediately usable.</html:strong>                     </html:p>                     <html:p>This is a key feature for a new model. In particular, it is very                         important that existing archival metadata, that are created or generated in                         current information systems, can be converted to RDF conforming to RiC-O,                         without losing any data, structural or partially implicit information. What                         is at stake here is that metadata conforming to the previous existing ICA                         standards can be processed successfully.</html:p>                     <html:p>During the ongoing development process, a lot of successful testing has                         been made, using XML/EAD finding aids and XML/EAC-CPF authority records,                         that have been converted to RDF datasets, either by hand or using scripts. A                         conversion software is being developed and will soon be available.</html:p>                     <html:p>While some existing metadata sets may have a very fine level of                         granularity and accuracy, already using, for example, controlled                         vocabularies, or describing curation events separately, often these metadata                         don’t have the very precise structure that RiC-CM recommends. Even then,                         such a conversion process should remain possible. In order to allow this,                         RiC-O sometimes provides several methods for representing information (as                         described below). From this point of view, the current official version of                         RiC-O may be considered a transitional ontology, in which some components                         may be deprecated later on.</html:p>                     <html:p> The usability of a model also depends on its documentation. That’s why                         the current official release has been fully documented (this documentation                         will be continously improved).</html:p>                     <html:p>RiC-O will also soon be acompanied with examples (RDF datasets). Some                         tutorials should also be written, and EGAD will organize practical                         workshops.</html:p>                     <html:p>                         <html:strong>RiC-O has to provide a flexible                         framework</html:strong>.</html:p>                     <html:p>This is a very important principle too. It is related with the usability                         principle quoted above. Moreover, archival description is flexible by                         essence. It is quite commonly noted that the level of granularity of                         information varies from one finding aid to another (or from one authority                         record to another), or even within the same finding aid. Some series or                         agents are described summarily because little is known about them and there                         is little time for extensive research, while other series, even records, or                         agents are described in detail; some relations (e.g. that relating to                         provenance) may be described without any detail while others may be                         thoroughly documented, as ISAAR(CPF) and EAC-CPF allow it.</html:p>                     <html:p>Being generally flexible, for an OWL ontology, depends first on the                         polyhierarchical systems of classes and properties it provides. A                         superproperty or superclass, more general or generic than its subproperties                         or subclasses, must exist and be available for handling information, while                         at the same time more accurate subcomponents must be there for handling more                         accurate description. Also, RiC-O should provide several methods for                         expressing whether relations are well attested and certain, or are more vague,                         as well as direct and short paths between entities alongside more complex                         ones.</html:p>                     <html:p>                         <html:strong>RiC-O opens new potential for archival                             description.</html:strong>                     </html:p>                     <html:p>This means that Linked Data tools and interfaces should enable end users                         to go through RDF/RiC-O graphs, to query them using SPARQL in an efficient                         way and to consult archival metadata and their contexts in new ways. As an example,                         an end user should be able to ask « What are (according to your dataset) the                         corporate bodies that succeeded to this given entity from its end of                         existence, by 1840, to nowadays (as concerns this given activity) ?» or «                         tell me what instantiations of this photograph exist? » « what are the                         existing copies of this original charter?», and get a list of these                         entities. In other words, institutions or projects that make the effort to                         implement RiC-O will get new insight into the content and context of their                         archives that wasn't visible with the existing ICA-standards. It should be                         even more interesting if you can infer new assertions from the RDF datasets                         you built, and of course link your datasets to other ressources outside of                         your institution.</html:p>                     <html:p>                         <html:strong>RiC-O should be extensible</html:strong>.</html:p>                     <html:p>Institutions are free to extend the ontology by adding new subclasses or                         subproperties if needed. RiC-O has also the potential to be useable in other                         contexts than purely archival ones. This implies that hierarchies of classes                         and properties are defined and that mappings are developed with other                         ontologies as mentioned above. It may also imply that RiC-O should provide                         “hooks” enabling connections with, for example, existing SKOS                         vocabularies.</html:p>                 </html:div>                 <html:div id="understanding-RiCO">                     <html:h4>Understanding RiC-O: a quick overview of some features</html:h4>                     <html:div id="fromRiCCM-to-RiCO">                         <html:h5>From RiC-CM to RiC-O</html:h5>                         <html:p>In the <html:strong>system of classes of RiC-O,</html:strong> for                             each RiC-CM entity, you can find a corresponding class. These classes                             are organized according to the same hierarchy as in RiC-CM. In some                             projects, you may need very few of them (e.g. Agent, Record Resource and                             Activity only), while in other ones, you may need more (e.g. Corporate                             Body and Person; Record; Place; Provenance Relation).</html:p>                         <html:p>Certain classes only exist in RiC-O and not in RiC-CM. These                             additional classes address special needs:</html:p>                         <html:ul>                             <html:li>some correspond to RiC-CM attributes, when it may be considered                                 necessary to handle them as full entities. This is the case for                                     <html:a href="#rico:Type">Type</html:a> and its subclasses, that                                 correspond to RiC-CM attributes that contain controlled values, and                                 that can help to articulate RiC-O with external RDF resources like                                 SKOS vocabularies; and also for <html:a href="#rico:Language">Language</html:a>, <html:a href="#rico:Name">Name</html:a> and                                     <html:a href="#rico:Identifier">Identifier</html:a>, that can be                                 considered as full entities and as key linking nodes in a RDF graph.                                 All these classes have been grouped under a <html:a href="#rico:Concept">Concept</html:a> class. </html:li>                             <html:li>some classes have been added in order to provide a more                                 accurate definition and model for some entities. <html:a href="#rico:Place">Place</html:a> thus comes along with a                                     <html:a href="#rico:PhysicalLocation">Physical Location                                     class</html:a>, and with a <html:a href="#rico:Coordinates">Coordinates class</html:a>. A Place is considered both a                                  geographical and historical entity. As a historical entity, among                                 other features, it has a history, and may be preceded or succeeded                                 by other Places. A Place also may have zero to many Physical                                 Location through time (for instance, its boundaries, if it is an                                 administrative area or a country, may change). Each Physical                                 Location may be connected to zero to many Coordinates. This model is                                 quite close to the Linked Places Format (<html:a href="https://github.com/LinkedPasts/linked-places">https://github.com/LinkedPasts/linked-places</html:a>). Another                                 example of such an addition is the <html:a href="#rico:Proxy">Proxy                                     class</html:a>, that represents (stands for) a Record Resource                                 as it exists in a specific Record Set.</html:li>                             <html:li>finally, a system of classes helps to implement the Relations                                 section of RiC-CM.<html:br></html:br> While these relations also are                                 represented as simple, binary object properties (e.g. <html:a href="#rico:hasProvenance">‘hasProvenance’</html:a> that                                 corresponds to RiC-R026 relation), you may need to assign different                                 attributes to a relation, e.g. a date, certainty or description, as                                 it is already possible, and quite often done, in a XML/EAC-CPF file.                                 One of the standard available methods for representing such a                                 documented relation in RDF for now is to use a class. RDF* and                                 SPARQL* specification, which is being developed by the W3C RDF-DEV                                 Community Group, provides a far simpler method (allowing to consider                                 a triple as the subject or object of another triple; see <html:a href="https://w3c.github.io/rdf-star/">https://w3c.github.io/rdf-star/</html:a>) and is already being                                 used by some tools; however it is not yet a W3C standard. Thus, for                                 example, in RiC-O an <html:a href="#rico:AgentOriginationRelation">AgentOriginationRelation class</html:a> exists. This class may                                 connect one to many Agents to one to many created or accumulated                                 Record Resources or Instantiations, and has some specific object                                 properties (certainty, date, description, source). Back to the                                 ‘hasProvenance’ object property, let us add that it is formally                                 defined in RiC-O, using OWL 2 property chain axiom (see <html:a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-new-features/">https://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-new-features/</html:a>, as a                                 ‘shortcut’ for the longer path                                 ‘recordResourceOrInstantiationIsSourceOfAgentOriginationRelation/agentOriginationRelationHasTarget’,                                 where the intermediate node is an instance of Agent Origination Relation:<html:br></html:br>                                 <html:code> <owl:propertyChainAxiom                                     rdf:parseType="Collection"> <html:br></html:br> <rdf:Description                                     rdf:about="https://www.ica.org/standards/RiC/ontology#recordResourceOrInstantiationIsSourceOfAgentOriginationRelation"/>                                     <html:br></html:br> <rdf:Description                                     rdf:about="https://www.ica.org/standards/RiC/ontology#agentOriginationRelationHasTarget"/>                                     <html:br></html:br> </owl:propertyChainAxiom> </html:code>                                 <html:br></html:br>A triplestore, with the appropriate configuration, may                                 thus infer the direct ‘hasProvenance’ assertion from this long                                 path.</html:li>                         </html:ul>                         <html:p>Most of the <html:strong>datatype properties in RiC-O                             </html:strong>correspond to RiC-CM attributes that contain free, plain                             text. See for example <html:a href="#rico:descriptiveNote">rico:descriptiveNote</html:a>, <html:a href="#rico:history">rico:history</html:a> and <html:a href="#scopeAndContent">rico:scopeAndContent</html:a>.</html:p>                         <html:p>In addition to these datatype properties, the Name and Identifier                             RiC-CM attributes also have corresponding classes (subclasses of <html:a href="#rico:Appellation">rico:Appellation</html:a>). A resource may                             have several Identifiers and each comes with different attributes (e.g.                             archival reference code, system number, digital object identifier), in                             this case the identifiers will be modelled in a class. In many simpler                             usecases it's sufficent to just use the <html:a href="#rico:identifier">identifier datatype property</html:a>, typically for the archival                             reference code.</html:p>                         <html:p>The Location RiC-CM attribute also has a <html:a href="#rico:PhysicalLocation">rico:Physical Location corresponding                                 class</html:a> (for users who want to use Place, Physical Location                             and Coordinates for handling places).</html:p>                         <html:p>As already said too, every RiC-CM attribute that has ‘controlled                             value’ or ‘rule-based’ as a schema value, has a class as corresponding                             component in RiC-O. For these CM attributes that correspond to a RiC-O                             class, as it is necessary to provide an immediately usable ontology, two                             supplementary datatype properties exist that allow not to use the                             classes, at least for a while, if you want to implement RiC-O and create                             RiC-O/RDF datasets from existing archival metadata without being able to                             handle URIs for the information you have.</html:p>                         <html:p>For example, you may not be able to handle and maintain URIs for                             some controlled values you use in EAD finding aids for carrier types:                             maybe your information system does not use a vocabulary for this, and                             you cannot for a while consider these carrier types as full entities.                             Nevertheless you want to produce RiC-O datasets where every piece of                             information is kept, and you want to avoid blank nodes. If RiC-O would                             only provide the Carrier Type class, it would be an issue for you. So                             RiC-O provides a <html:a href="#rico:type">rico:type datatype                                 property</html:a>, with range rdfs:literal, which allows you to move                             forward.</html:p>                         <html:p>Therefore, for the RiC-CM *Type attributes, you have a corresponding                                 <html:a href="#rico:type">rico:type datatype property</html:a>. For                             RiC-CM Coordinates attribute, you also have <html:a href="#rico:geographicalCoordinates">rico:geographicalCoordinates                                 datatype property</html:a>.</html:p>                         <html:p>These datatype properties have a skos:scopeNote which says (for                             example) "Provided for usability reasons.

Use only if you don't use Physical Location and                             Coordinates classes with Place."</html:p>                         <html:p>The same key design principle (RiC-O must be immediately usable) led                             us to define some datatype properties that would enable users to use                             RiC-O in simple usecases where they do not want to consider dates and                             rules as full entities. Thus, there of course is Date and Rule classes                             in RiC-O (since there are Date and Rule entities in RiC-CM). And you                             also have 'date' datatype properties; plus a <html:a href="#rico:ruleFollowed">rico:ruleFollowed datatype                                 property</html:a>. The same analysis led us to keep the <html:a href="#rico:history">rico:history</html:a> datatype property in                             RiC-O (same as RiC-CM history attribute), while RiC-CM and RiC-O also                             provide the <html:a href="#rico:Event">Event class</html:a>, and using a                             series of Events may of course be a better method, easier to query, link                             and display, than simply using a history prose discourse. The two                             methods may be used in parallel within the same dataset by an                             institution that, for example, would decide to emphasize only the                             accession, appraisal and description events among the whole history of                             Record resources.</html:p>                         <html:p>These datatype properties have the same kind of skos:scopeNote as                             above.</html:p>                         <html:p>Finally, we have introduced a few datatype properties that do not                             correspond to any RiC-CM attribute.</html:p>                         <html:p>Some are superproperties, and thus group datatype properties                                 (<html:a href="#rico:physicalOrLogicalExtent">rico:physicalOrLogicalExtent</html:a>, with rico:carrierExtent,                             rico:instantiationExtent and rico:recordResourceExtent as subproperties                             ; <html:a href="#rico:textualValue">rico:textualValue</html:a>, with                             rico:expressedDate and rico:normalizedValue as subproperties; <html:a href="#rico:measure">rico:measure</html:a> (and its subproperties);                                 <html:a href="#rico:referenceSystem">rico:referenceSystem</html:a>,                             superproperty of rico:dateStandard (and of other datatype properties                             that do not exist in RiC-CM.)</html:p>                         <html:p>Some are simply more specific properties : <html:a href="#rico:accrualStatus">rico:accrualStatus</html:a> ; <html:a href="#rico:recordResourceStructure">rico:recordResourceStructure</html:a> and <html:a href="#rico:instantiationStructure">rico:instantiationStructure</html:a>, subproperties of                             rico:structure ; <html:a href="#rico:title">rico:title</html:a>                             (subproperty of rico:name) ; rico:altitude, rico:latitude,                             rico:longitude (subproperties of rico:measure), rico:geodesicSystem and                             rico:altimetricSystem (subproperties of rico:referenceSystem).</html:p>                         <html:p>In order to connect all the classes created, <html:strong>a                                 significant number of object properties have been                                 defined</html:strong>. While their 'flat' list is a long one, they                             are grouped hierarchically, so that one can use the upper to                             intermediate level ones for simplicity sake, or choose the most accurate                             and expressive ones, or extend the system adding a subproperty easily.                             It is expected that, in most use cases, a subset of these properties                             only will be needed. As already said above, some of the object                             properties are also formally defined as shortcuts.</html:p>                         <html:p>Finally, let us mention that we added to RiC-O six individuals,                             considering that they would address current and frequent needs:</html:p>                         <html:ul>                             <html:li>Two (<html:a href="#FindingAid">FindingAid</html:a> and <html:a href="#AuthorityRecord">AuthorityRecord</html:a>) are                                  instances of both RiC-O Documentary Form Type and SKOS Concept.                                 They can be used for categorizing Records, finding aids and                                 authority records being considered as Records. A Record that would                                 have ‘Finding Aid’ as a Documentary Form Type, can be connected to                                 one to many Record Resources using 'rico:describes’ object                                 property.</html:li>                             <html:li>Four (<html:a href="#Fonds">Fonds</html:a>, <html:a href="#Series">Series</html:a>, <html:a href="#File">File</html:a>, and <html:a href="#Collection">Collection</html:a>) are both instances of the Record Set Type                                 class, and of skos:Concept.

This has been done,                             following RiC-CM v0.2 updates and applying a few naming rules, so that,                             for example, the same verb is used for naming a relation and the inverse                             relation when it exists.</html:li>                         <html:li>adding suggestions of mappings (in rico:closeTo) and OWL                             equivalences between some classes or properties and components in other                             models (among which - this is not an exhaustive list- CIDOC-CRM,                             IFLA-LRM, PREMIS, PROV-O, Wikidata and Schema.org)</html:li>                         <html:li>documenting RiC-O in French and Spanish</html:li>                         <html:li>providing users with some SPARQL constructs for                             inferring.</html:li>                     </html:ul>                 </html:div>             </html:div>|
