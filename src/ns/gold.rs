    /// `AbessiveCase`: AbessiveCase expresses the lack or absence of the referent of the noun it marks. It has the meaning of the English preposition 'without' [Pei and Gaynor 1954: 3, 35].
    AbessiveCase, "AbessiveCase",
    /// `AbilitativeModality`: AbilitativeModality indicates the capacity of an agent to perform some action, regardless of type or condition. This is also known as the abilitive. 
    AbilitativeModality, "AbilitativeModality",
    /// `AblativeCase`: Ablative case denotes the source, agent, means, and occasionally also time or place of an an act or occurence. [Pei and Gaynor 1954: 3]
    AblativeCase, "AblativeCase",
    /// `AbsolutiveAntipassiveVoice`: A term used by some Mayanists to refer to an antipassive in which the patient or logical object is supressed or overtly absent. [Klaiman 1991: 232] Dayley states that the absolutive antipassive is used when the patient is unknown or irrelevant, or when the speaker does not wish to mention the patient, or to describe a transitive activity typically performed by some agent. The absolutive antipassive requires a non-specific implied patient, and no specific patient is ever semantically recoverable from the speech context. Only the absolutive antipassive has (as the name implies) absolutive function such that a transitive activity may be discussed without mention of the patient. [Dayley 1985: 345-350] This type of antipassive with an obligatorily unidentified object is also found in Mam, another Mayan language. [Cooreman 1994: 52-53] 
    AbsolutiveAntipassiveVoice, "AbsolutiveAntipassiveVoice",
    /// `AbsolutiveCase`: AbsolutiveCase in ergative-absolutive languages marks referents that would generally be the subjects of intransitive verbs or the objects of transitive verbs in the translational equivalents of nominative-accusative languages [Anderson 1985: 181; Crystal 1985: 1; Andrews 1985: 138].
    AbsolutiveCase, "AbsolutiveCase",
    /// `Abstract`: Properties or qualities as distinguished from any particular embodiment of the properties/ qualities in a physical medium. Instances of Abstract can be said to exist in the same sense as mathematical objects such as sets and relations, but they cannot exist at a particular place and time without some physical encoding or embodiment. [SUMO 2010]
    Abstract, "Abstract",
    /// `AccusativeCase`: AccusativeCase in nominative-accusative languages marks certain syntactic functions, usually direct objects [Hartmann and Stork 1972: 3, 156; Crystal 1980: 11, 246; Andrews 1985: 75; Anderson 1985: 181].

    ActionalForce, "ActionalForce",
    /// `ActiveVoice`: Associated with transitivity, when the action is performed by an agent (subject) on another participant (object) [McIntosh 1984: 108]. It refers to the category of underived verb forms associated with the basic diathesis [Shibatani 1995: 7].
    ActiveVoice, "ActiveVoice",
    /// `AdessiveCase`: AdessiveCase expresses that  the referent of the noun it marks is the location near/at which another referent exists. It has the meaning of 'at' or 'near' [Crystal 1997: 8].
    AdessiveCase, "AdessiveCase",
    /// `Adjectival`: An adjectival, or 'adjective', is a part of speech whose members modify nouns. An adjectival specifies the attributes of a noun referent. Note: this is one case among many. Adjectivals are a class of modifiers. An adjectival may be inflected as comparitive or superlative [Crystal 1997: 8; Payne 1997: 63].
    Adjectival, "Adjectival",
    /// `AdjectivePhrase`: A phrase with an adjective as a head. [Crystal 2003: 11] Adjective phrases may contain complements following the head, and modifiers in either pre-head or post-head position, but for the  most part, complements in adjective phrase structure are optional elements: they qualify as complements by virtue of being licensed by the head rather than  being obligatory. [Huddleston and Pullum 2002: 22-23, 57, 542]
    AdjectivePhrase, "AdjectivePhrase",
    /// `AdjunctSubordinate`: A word or phrase which is used to extend the meaning of another word or phrase, but which is not one of the main structural elements of a sentence [Hartmann and Stork 1972: 5]. Adjunct clauses include subordinate clauses (i.e. those with overt subordinating conjunctions).
    AdjunctSubordinate, "AdjunctSubordinate",
    /// `Adposition`: An adposition is a part of speech whose members are of a closed set and occur before or after a complement composed of a noun phrase, noun, pronoun, or clause that functions as a noun phrase and forms a single structure with the complement to express its grammatical and semantic relation to another unit within a clause [Comrie 1989: 91; Crystal 1997: 305; Payne 1997: 86].
    Adposition, "Adposition",
    /// `Adverbial`: An adverbial, or 'adverb', narrowly defined, is a part of speech whose members modify verbs for such categories as time, manner, place, or direction. An adverbal, broadly defined, is a part of speech whose members modify any constituent class of words other than nouns, such as verbs, adjectives, adverbs, phrases, clauses, or sentences. Under this definition, the possible type of modification depends on the class of the constituent being modified [Crystal 1997: 11; Payne 1997: 69].
    Adverbial, "Adverbial",
    /// `Adverbializer`: An adverbializer is a subordinating connective that links a subordinate clause  to a main clause, and indicates that the subordinate clause has an adverbial or interpropositional relation  to the main clause, indicating purpose, condition, time, and location. [SIL International 2004]
    Adverbializer, "Adverbializer",
    /// `Affix`: An affix is a morpheme with an abstract meaning which can only be used when added to a root morpheme.  These are classified in four different ways, depending on their position with reference to the root: suffix, prefix, circumfix and infix. [Haspelmath 2002: 265; Crystal 1980: 17]
    Affix, "Affix",
    /// `AgentDeletionPassiveVoice`: The object of the active retains its old case-marking in the passive, the subject of the active cannot appear in the passive clause, and the passive tends to be semantically active [Givon 1988: 419].
    AgentDeletionPassiveVoice, "AgentDeletionPassiveVoice",
    /// `AirstreamProperty`: Refers to the direction of the airstream in speech sound production. In the canonical literature, there are three airstream mechanisms: pulmonic, velaric, and glottalic. Glottalic airstream mechanism is sometimes used to describe the method of production of ejectives and implosives. Ladefoged and Maddieson prefer to regard implosives and ejectives as characterized by a laryngeal parameter of movement rather than an airstream property. [Ladefoged and Maddieson 1996: 372-373]
    AirstreamProperty, "AirstreamProperty",
    /// `AllativeCase`: AllativeCase expresses motion to or toward the referent of the noun it marks [Pei and Gaynor 1954: 6, 9, 216; Lyons 1968: 299; Crystal 1985: 1213].
    AllativeCase, "AllativeCase",
    /// `Alveolar`: Characterizing sounds produced with the alveolar ridge as the passive articulator [Ladefoged 1997: 598].
    Alveolar, "Alveolar",
    /// `AnimateGender`: A grammatical gender property assigned to a class of nouns with animate denotation. In a given language it may include larger or smaller numbers of nouns which do not meet this semantic criterion. The animate gender may occur in a two-gender system, with the other gender being labeled inanimate. However, the animate gender may also occur in larger inventories (i.e. greater than two values). Examples of these larger systems are found in Bantu languages (where nouns denoting humans are included in the animate gender) and in languages of Daghestan (where the animate gender is typically for non-human animates) [Corbett 1991: 20-32].
    AnimateGender, "AnimateGender",
    /// `AnnotationProperty`: 'Linguistic annotation' covers any descriptive or analytic notations applied to raw language data. The basic data may be in the form of time functions - audio, video and/or physiological recordings - or it may be textual. The added notations may include transcriptions of all sorts (from phonetic features to discourse structures), part-of-speech and sense tagging, syntactic analysis, 'named entity' identification, co-reference annotation, and so on. [Bird and Liberman 2000: 1]
    AnnotationProperty, "AnnotationProperty",
    /// `AnteriorProperty`: Properties characterized by focusing on the upper passive articulator on the roof of the mouth [Ladefoged 1997: 597].
    AnteriorProperty, "AnteriorProperty",
    /// `AntiCausativeVoice`: An intransitive verb is derived from a basically transitive one with the direct object of the transitive verb corresponding to the subject of the intransitive [Siewierska 1988: 267].
    AntiCausativeVoice, "AntiCausativeVoice",
    /// `AntiPassiveVoice`: In the antipassive construction, the patient-like argument is either suppressed (left implicit) or realized as an oblique complement, rather than as a direct object as would be the case in the basic two-place predicate transitive construction. The antipassive voice is most commonly found in ergative languages. In this case, the direct object, which is in the absolutive case in the transitive construction, is no longer marked as absolutive, but is marked as oblique or is supressed entirely. The agent-like argument, marked as ergative in a typical transitive construction, is instead marked as absolutive, making it appear like the agent of an intransitive construction. [Polinsky 2008]
    AntiPassiveVoice, "AntiPassiveVoice",
    /// `Apical`: Characterizing sounds produced by the tip of the tongue [Ladefoged 1997: 596].
    Apical, "Apical",
    /// `ApicalityProperty`: Properties characterized by focusing on the action of the lower, active articulator, i.e. which part of the tongue is used in articulation [Ladefoged 1997: 597].
    ApicalityProperty, "ApicalityProperty",
    /// `ApplicativeVoice`: The applicative voice is a grammatical voice which promotes an oblique argument of a verb to the (core) patient argument, and indicates the oblique role within the meaning of the verb. Applicatives have a degree of overlap with causatives, and in some languages are realized identically; this isomorphism can be found in Kinyarwanda [Kimenyi 1980: 164], Yagua, Malay, and Dyirbal [Croft 1990: 242].   While differing from true applicatives, a similar construction known as dative shifting occurs in other languages, including English. Two subtle differences between applicative and dative-shift constructions are: (1) applicatives involve some marking on the verb whereas dative-shift constructions do not; and (2) dative-shift constructions typically allow only recipients and benefactives to become direct objects whereas applicative constructions normally advance instruments and perhaps other obliques. [Payne 1997: 186-192]
    ApplicativeVoice, "ApplicativeVoice",
    /// `Approximant`: This term is used to classify sounds based on their manner of articulation.  Sounds possessing this trait are those in which the involved articulators approach one another, but not close enough to produce audible friction. [Crystal 1980: 30]
    Approximant, "Approximant",
    /// `ArabicNumeralGender`: A labeling convention for gender categories. Arabic numerals are often used for languages for which there is a descriptive tradition involving use of the term 'noun class' instead of 'gender', in particular in languages of the Caucasus or Bantu languages; If the 'noun classes' are involved in agreement systems, they are gender systems. Arabic numerals may also be used in instances where another label is possible. For instance, in one language the gender to which nouns with human denotation are assigned might be called 'human', whereas in another language nouns with a similar denotation may be assigned to a gender with an arbitrary Arabic numerical label such as '1'. [Kibort and Corbett 2008a]
    ArabicNumeralGender, "ArabicNumeralGender",
    /// `Article`: An article is a member of a small class of determiners that identify a noun's definite or indefinite reference, and new or given status [Crystal 1997: 26].
    Article, "Article",
    /// `ArticulatoryProperty`: The class of properties defining how sounds are produced in the mouth.  [Ladefoged 
    ArticulatoryProperty, "ArticulatoryProperty",
    /// `AspectProperty`: The term 'aspect'; designates the perspective taken on the internal temporal organization of the event, and different values of the Aspect Feature distinguish different ways of viewing the internal temporal constituency of the same event [Comrie 1976: 3ff], after [Holt 1943: 6; Bybee 2003: 157]. The 'event' is understood here as a general term covering any situation type (a state, activity, accomplishment, achievement, etc.) as expressed by the verb phrase of the construction. Unlike Tense Feature, which expresses event-external time and is deictic, Aspect Feature is event-internal and non-deictic, as it is not concerned with relating the time of the event to any other time point. [Kibort 2008e]  
    AspectProperty, "AspectProperty",
    /// `Aspirated`: A sound is described as 'aspirated' when it has a greater rate of airflow than occurs in modal voice for a period of time before or after a stricture. It often accompanies a consonant which precedes a vowel, the beginning of which is unvoiced. [Ladefoged 
    Aspirated, "Aspirated",
    /// `AssumptiveEvidentiality`: One of the three types of judgment common in languages, that indicates inference from what is generally known. English has the contrast between Deductive and Assumptive, as shown in: 'John must be in his office', 'John'll be in his office'. Schlichter comments that the speaker believes the case to be true…in the case of the Assumptive ‘because of his experience with similar situations, regular patterns, or repeated circumstances common in human life’. It is used when the speaker has prior knowledge about the state of things or about habitual or general 'behavior patterns', but 'only when no information about the state or event is being or has been received'. In that sense it is the negative member of the evidential system, used when no ready evidence is available. [Palmer 2001: 24-25; 30; 51]
    AssumptiveEvidentiality, "AssumptiveEvidentiality",
    /// `AttestedVariety`: A linguistic form for which there is evidence of present or past use. Attestation refers to something that is found in actual recorded usage, compared with the hypothetical predictions of grammar or the intuitive (but otherwise unsupported) observations of the linguist.[Crystal 2003: 41]
    AttestedVariety, "AttestedVariety",
    /// `AuditoryEvidentiality`: AuditoryEvidentiality encodes the fact that the speaker came to believe the content of the expression through direct auditory experience; they heard it. This does not include spoken reported accounts, but only direct sensory evidence, such as the situation of 'hearing a tree fall' [Palmer 2001: 38].
    AuditoryEvidentiality, "AuditoryEvidentiality",
    /// `AugmentativeSize`: A special form of a noun that signals that the object being referred to is large relative to the usual size of such an object [Crystal 1980: 34].
    AugmentativeSize, "AugmentativeSize",
    /// `Auxiliary`: Auxiliary is a term used to describe verbs which are used in coordination with another verb to express mood, tense or aspect of the action denoted by the main verb.  Marginal auxiliaries share some of these properties, but not all. [Crystal 1985: 28; Pei 
    Auxiliary, "Auxiliary",
    /// `AversiveCase`: AversiveCase expresses fear or is literally translated as 'turning from' in some languages [Blake 2001: 156].
    AversiveCase, "AversiveCase",
    /// `Back`: A vowel sound produced with the tongue retracted towards the back of the oral cavity, e.g. [a:] as in English ‘calm’ or [u:] as in English ‘soon’. [Hartmann and Stork 1972: 25]
    Back, "Back",
    /// `BacknessProperty`: A feature of vowel quality that correlates the difference between frequencies of formant two and formant one (overtones corresponding to a resonating frequency of the air in the vocal tract) [Ladefoged 2000: 215, 273]
    BacknessProperty, "BacknessProperty",
    /// `BenefactiveCase`: BenefactiveCase expresses that the referent of the noun it marks receives the benefit of the situation expressed by the clause [Crystal 1980: 43].
    BenefactiveCase, "BenefactiveCase",
    /// `BinaryPredicator`: Binary predicates define relationships between keywords. Each binary predicate is viewed as function: given the value of the first argument, it returns the set of values for the second argument that would make the predicate true. [Feldman and Hirsh 1996: 344] BinaryPredicators are the class of syntactic words that require two arguments. 
    BinaryPredicator, "BinaryPredicator",
    /// `BoundMorpheme`: A bound morpheme (or bound form) is one which cannot occur on its own as a separate word, e.g. various affixes de-, -tion, -ize. [Crystal 2003: 56]
    BoundMorpheme, "BoundMorpheme",
    /// `Breathy`: With regard to classifications of vocal qualities, this refers to an effect produced by allowing a large amount of air to pass through the partially open glottis.  Some speakers have this as a permanent characteristic of their speech patterns. [Crystal 1985: 38]
    Breathy, "Breathy",
    /// `BuccalProperty`: A subclass of place properties roughly referring to positions inside the mouth [Ladefoged 1997: 606].

    /// `CategoryChanger`: CategoryChanger is a cover class for all derivational units that change the syntactic category of the root to which they are attached.
    CategoryChanger, "CategoryChanger",
    /// `CausativeVoice`: A construction can be classified as a morphological causative when there is specific morphological encoding of causativity within the verb. Moreover, a causative is associated with an additional core argument, a causer or causal agent, added to the set of core arguments assigned by the corresponding noncausative verb. [Klaiman 1991: 51]
    CausativeVoice, "CausativeVoice",
    /// `Central`: Characterizing sounds produced with the tongue  near the center of the mouth (along the front-back dimension).

[Oxford English Dictionary 2010]  Note: This concept was included in order to facilitate linking to the bibliographic entries referenced in GOLD.
    Citation, "Citation",
    /// `Class`: This term refers to a set of entities, be they words, morphemes or otherwise, which share certain formal or semantic properties.  [Crystal 1980: 60]
    Class, "Class",
    /// `Classifier`: In grammar, a morpheme whose function is to indicate the formal or semantic class to which items belong are  sometimes called classifiers, e.g. -ly is an adverb classifier, -ess is a 'femininity' classifier. The marking of lexical items as belonging to the same semantic class is an important feature in many languages (e.g. Chinese, Vietnamese, Hopi), and sometimes quite unexpected bases of classification are found, in terms of shape, size, colour, movability, animacy, status and so on. [Crystal 2003: 74]
    Classifier, "Classifier",
    /// `Clause`: A clause is a subdivision of a sentence containing a subject (argument) and predicate.  It is possible to have a word that implies or refers to a predicate rather than one explicitly stated. [Pei 
    Clause, "Clause",
    /// `Clitic`: Clitic is the class of units which members exhibit syntactic characteristics of a lexical unit, but show evidence of being morphologically bound to another lexical unit, the host, by being unstressed or subject to word-level phonological rules [Crystal 1980: 64; Hartmann and Stork 1972: 38; Anderson 1985: 158; Klavans 1982: xi-xiv, 74-76, 83, 93-95, 100-101; Zwicky 1977: 5].

Hence, continuousness can be defined negatively as imperfectivity that is not habituality [Comrie 1976: 26-32], and it can be regarded as a sub-type of imperfectivity.  Typically, for an aspect value to be labelled as Continuous, the aspectual meaning has to minimally express continuousness, although it may additionally express other temporal, aspectual, or modal meanings, or actionality distinctions.  Continuous aspectual meaning can be further subdivided into two types: progressive meaning and nonprogressive meaning.

So far, the concept of ‘assignment of a feature value’ has not been used outside gender. For some features, there may not be as much to say as for gender. However, using the concept of ‘assignment’ with respect to the values of all features is useful to be able to compare the features. Therefore, for this typology I have adopted the following definition: an assignment system is a set of rules that realise the value of a feature on an element. Note, however, that under this definition, a gender value is ‘assigned’ both to nouns, and to targets of agreement in gender with the noun. [Kibort 2008d: 8]

In generative syntax there are also several constraints which have to be imposed in order to prevent the derivation of ill formed phrase-markers, e.g. constraints on the ordering of rules. The notion of constraints takes on a different direction in optimality theory, where it is the principle explanatory device. Here, constraints are ways of characterizing language universals. Each language has its own ranking of constraints (e.g. which determine morpheme position or syllable structure), and differences between these rankings result in the variations observed between languages.

Most commonly, this tense meaning is referred to as 'future', because in absolute tense systems the deictic centre is the moment of speech. However, in relative tense systems, where the deictic centre can be moved to any point on the time line, it is more appropriate to refer to this temporal relation as 'posterior'. The posterior temporal relation may obtain either in 'simple' or 'perfect' contexts. Modelling of this distinction originates from [Reichenbach 1947], who suggested using a third point in time, 'reference point', to capture all possible tense distinctions. In all 'simple' temporal relations, the reference point coincides with the location of the event spoken about. 'Perfect' tense meanings are created when the reference point is separated and moved away from the event time, thus altering the viewing of the temporal location of the event even though the event's actual location with respect to the deictic centre remains the same. Posterior temporal relationships obtaining in a 'perfect' context occur when the reference point is moved away from the event time. There are various logical possibilities for locating the reference point with respect to the other two points, though none of them seem to be typically grammaticalised as separate tenses. Typically, for a tense value to be labelled as Future Tense, the tense meaning has to minimally express the posterior temporal relationship, although it may additionally express other temporal, aspectual, or modal meanings.

Sounds can have the vocal cords tightly together, as in a glottal stop, or they can be far apart as in voiceless sounds, or they can have one of the three phonation types: breathy voice, modal voice and creaky voice. Although some phoneticians have shown how terms similar to these may be combinable from the phonetic point of view, the named terms form a set of phonologically mutually exclusive possibilities. These factors point to there being an ordered set of five possibilities: [voiceless], [breathy], [modal voice], [creaky] and [closed]. It is certainly appropriate to consider these glottal states as resulting from two physiological attributes of the vocal cords, their stiffness and their aperture. However from a linguistic point of view, the named values of the feature Glottal Stricture operate as a linearly ordered set of five mutually exclusive possibilities. [Ladefoged 1997: 607-608]

The decision that a situation is characteristic of an extended period of time is not in itself linguistic, but once it has been made, an explicitly habitual form can be used to describe it. Note that the classification of a situation as characteristic of a period of time is not derived directly from the comparison of their length or frequency; hence, the situation may be objectively either long or short, and either frequent or infrequent, with respect to the period it characterises. This is because the way we choose to characterise can involve a component which is objectively small in relation to the whole. Typically, for an aspect value to be labelled as Habitual, the aspectual meaning has to minimally express habituality, although it may additionally express other temporal, aspectual, or modal meanings, or actionality distinctions. Habituality can in principle be combined with any other semantic aspectual values appropriate to situations that can be protracted in time or iterated [Comrie 1976: 26-32].

By definition, a linguistic sign must have a form component (whose elements are phonological units), a grammatical component (whose elements are grammatical units), and a meaning component (whose elements are semantic units). The formal structure of a linguistic sign is determined by the grammar of a language. The information value of a linguistic sign, its meaning, is not fixed, but determined by the conventions of the language. The relation of form to meaning is largely arbitrary within a semiotic system. Signs are classified primarily according to what kinds of formal relations they participate in, and, secondly, according to their complexity (whether they are atomic or composed of other signs). Signs range from morphological and syntactic constructions to whole discourse segments [de Saussure 1983; Hervey 1979; Pollard and Sag 1994].

    /// `PastTense`: A value of Tense Feature assigned to the designated element in the clause when the meaning selected for the clause is that intended to locate the event spoken about as anterior to the deictic centre of the utterance. Most commonly, this tense meaning is referred to as 'past', because in absolute tense systems the deictic centre is the moment of speech. However, in relative tense systems, where the deictic centre can be moved to any point on the time line, it is more appropriate to refer to this temporal relation as 'anterior'. The anterior temporal relation may obtain either in 'simple' or 'perfect' contexts. Modelling of this distinction originates from Reichenbach (1947), who suggested using a third point in time, 'reference point', to capture all possible tense distinctions. In all 'simple' temporal relations, the reference point coincides with the location of the event spoken about. 'Perfect' tense meanings are created when the reference point is separated and moved away from the event time, thus altering the viewing of the temporal location of the event even though the event's actual location with respect to the deictic centre remains the same. A common instance of an anterior temporal relationship obtaining in a 'perfect' context occurs when the reference point is moved away from the event time and located instead at the moment of speech. The event time is still anterior to the moment of speech, but it is viewed against a stretch of time which began at the event and continues up to the moment of speech --- e.g. the English I have read this book, I have seen John --- hence the interpretation that the event has an effect or is in some way still relevant at the moment of speech. In some languages (e.g. English) this tense meaning is labelled as (one of the uses of the) Present Perfect, in others (e.g. Polish) this meaning may be collapsed with the 'simple' anterior meaning and labelled simply as Past. Typically, for a tense value to be labelled as Past Tense, the tense meaning has to minimally express the anterior temporal relationship, although it may additionally express other temporal relationships or aspectual and/or modal meanings. For example, when the usage of the Past Tense value is restricted to a semantically defined domain, it is conventional to add a further qualification to the label of the Past Tense value (e.g. Past Imperfective --- when the anterior temporal relationship is necessarily combined with an aspectual meaning of the Imperfective Aspect value, and grammaticalised as a single [Tense-Aspect-Mood (TAM)] category in the language).

There are two types of 'perfect' context which may lead to separate tense values: (1) The first type occurs when the reference point is moved away from the event time and instead located after the event time. A common example occurs with an anterior temporal relationship, when the reference point is moved from the event time to the moment of speech. The event time is anterior to the moment of speech, but it is viewed against a stretch of time which began at the event and continues up to the moment of speech --- e.g. the English I have read this book, I have seen John --- hence the interpretation that the event has an effect or is in some way still relevant at the moment of speech. [Note that in some languages (e.g. English) this tense meaning is labelled as (one of the uses of the) Present Perfect, in others (e.g. Polish) this meaning may be collapsed with the 'simple' anterior meaning and labelled simply as Past.] The interpretation of this type of the perfect often includes at least two related but distinguishable uses: the resultative perfect (Someone has stolen my purse) and the experiential perfect (I have read this book before) [Dahl and Velupillai 2005: 271]. (2) The second type occurs when the reference point is moved away from the event time and instead located before the event time. A common example occurs with a simultaneous temporal relationship, when the reference point is moved from the event time and located before the moment of speech. The event time is still simultaneous with the moment of speech, but it is viewed against a stretch of time which began at the reference point and continues up to the moment of speech --- e.g. the English I have lived here [for ten years] --- hence the interpretation that the event which began in the past extends up to the moment of speech. [Note that in some languages (e.g. English) this tense meaning is labelled as (one of the uses of the) Present Perfect, in others (e.g. Polish) this meaning may be collapsed with the 'simple' simultaneous meaning and labelled simply as Present.] The interpretation of this type of the perfect is often referred to as the universal perfect or perfect of persistent situation. Typically, for a tense value to be labelled as Perfect Tense, the tense meaning has to minimally express the meaning resulting from the separation of the reference point from the event time, although it may additionally express other temporal, aspectual, or modal meanings.

    /// `PhasalAspect`: A set of aspectual distinctions involving relations between a background situation (the reference situation) and a situation located relative to the reference situation (the denoted situation). In English, phasal distinctions are expressed by auxiliary-headed constructions, like the inceptive, progressive, and perfect constructions, whose head verbs express the aspectual class of the denoted situation. The aspectual class of the denoted situation differs from that of the reference situation [Michaelis 1998: xv]. An event may have a beginning and an end, a middle portion (continuing or changing), and also an ensuing result or an altered state. These are considered to be the various "phases" of an event. A speaker may talk about an event from the point of view of any of these individual phases, and his language may have inflectional (or other type of) markers for representing these distinctions. Since such markers indicate distinctions in the temporal structure of an event, we may regard them as belonging to the category of aspect. It has been suggested [Dik 1989: 186] that these may be grouped under a subcategory (or "level") of aspect called "phasal aspect". [Bhat 1999: 49]

However, in relative tense systems, where the deictic centre can be moved to any point on the time line, it is more appropriate to refer to this temporal relation as 'simultaneous'. It is important to note --- for all tense values, but in particular for the Present Tense --- that the 'times' which are used to locate the event, the deictic centre, and the reference point, may or may not be 'points' on the time line. Conventionally, these concepts are considered neutral with regard to whether they are points or intervals of time longer than a point. In a formal model of tense meanings they could, for example, be represented as sets (of points): in order to capture temporal distinctions, the notion of an event being 'simultaneous with the moment of speech', may be understood as (the set of) event time (points) and (the set of) speech time (points) having a non-empty intersection. Hence, this semantic model of the Present Tense value may include the interpretation of the present as 'universal' or 'generic'.

Roman numerals are often used for languages for which there is a descriptive tradition involving use of the term 'noun class' instead of 'gender', in particular in languages of the Caucasus or Bantu languages, and are particularly useful where the number of genders is large.If the 'noun classes' are involved in agreement systems, they are gender systems. Roman numerals may also be used in instances where another label is possible. In one language the gender to which nouns with male rational denotation are assigned might be called 'masculine', whereas in another language nouns with a similar denotation may be assigned to a gender with an arbitrary Roman numerical label such as 'I'.

[Trask 1999: 335] According to the valence of the verb, the number and kind of the obligatory complements may vary; in addition, any number of free complements are possible. The border between obligatory and free complementsis often difficult to draw. [Bussmann 1996: 513]

    /// `Verbal`: A Verbal is a part of speech whose members typically signal events and actions; constitute, singly or in a phrase, a minimal  predicate in a  clause; govern the number and types of other constituents which may occur in the clause; and, in inflectional languages, may be inflected for tense, aspect, voice, modality, or agreement with other constituents in person, number, or grammatical gender  [Crystal 1997: 409; Givon 1984: 52; Payne 1997: 47].

    /// `VerbalParticle`: Verbal particles are a closed class of uninflected words that co-occur with certain verbs. In some cases the verbal particles may have clearly distinguishable locative or directional meanings. In some languages some or all of the verbal particles also occur as (and are historically derived from) adpositions. In other languages, however, for example Ga'anda, the verbal particles are entirely distinct from adpositions. [Schachter 1985: 45-46]

    /// `VoiceProperty`: VoiceProperty is the class of properties that concern the grammatical encoding of the relationship between the verb and the nominals in a subject-predicate configuration. It selects a grammatically prominent syntactic constituent--subject--from the underlying semantic functions. In accusative language, the basic strategy is to select an agent as a subject [Shibatani 1988: 3]. It can be said that all voice systems mark the affectedness/nonaffectedness of sentential subjects [Klaiman 1988: 30].

    /// `VoicingProperty`: Refers to the vibratory activity of the vocal folds. Most languages have phonemic contrasts between voiced and voiceless sounds (regular vibration of the vocal folds versus no vibration of the vocal folds respectively). However, Ladefoged and Maddieson recognize five steps in the continuum of modes of vibration in the glottis, going from breathy voice - the most open setting of the vocal folds in which vibration will occur, passing through slack voice, modal voice, and stiff voice, ending with creaky voice - the most constricted setting in which vibration will occur. Each of these modes of voicing may or may not be phonemic in a given language. [Ladefoged and Maddieson 1996: 48-49]

Phonetically, they are sounds articulated without a complete closure in the mouth that would produce a stop or a degree of narrowing that would create audible friction; the air escapes evenly over the center of the tongue. For oral vowels, air escapes solely through the mouth. If some air is simultaneously released through the nose, the vowel is nasal. The quality of the vowel sound is affected by the shape of the oral resonance chamber, chiefly influenced by the position of the lips and the position of the tongue.
