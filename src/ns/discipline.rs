    /// `Aerodynamics`: <p>Aerodynamics is the study of the motion of air, particularly its interaction with a solid object, such as an airplane wing. Aerodynamics is a sub-field of fluid dynamics and gas dynamics, and many aspects of aerodynamics theory are common to these fields. The term aerodynamics is often used synonymously with gas dynamics, the difference being that &quot;gas dynamics&quot; applies to the study of the motion of all gases, and is not limited to air.</p>

    /// `Astrionics`: <p><em>Astrionics</em> is the science and technology of the development and application of electronic systems, sub-systems, and components used in spacecraft. The electronic systems on board a spacecraft include attitude determination and control, communications, command and telemetry, and computer systems. Sensors refers to the electronic components on board a spacecraft. For engineers one of the most important considerations that must be made in the design process is the environment in which the spacecraft systems and components must operate and endure. The challenges of designing systems and components for the space environment include more than the fact that space is a vacuum.</p>

    /// `HypersonicAerodynamics`: <p><em>Hypersonic Aerodynamics</em> is a special branch of the study of aeronautics. The chief characteristic of hypersonic aerodynamics is that the temperature of the flow around the aircraft is so great that the chemistry of the gas must be considered. At low hypersonic speeds, the molecular bonds vibrate, which changes the magnitude of the forces generated by the air on the aircraft. At higher hypersonic speeds, the molecules break apart producing an electrically charged plasma around the aircraft. Large variations in air density and pressure occur because of shock waves, and expansions. Hypersonic aircraft typically have very thick boundary layers along the surface and high heat transfer to the surface. All of these high speed flow phenomena lead to a vehicle design unlike the typical airliner or fighter aircraft.</p>
